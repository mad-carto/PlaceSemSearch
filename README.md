# **SemantiPlace App**  

Welcome to **SemantiPlace**, a **Streamlit-based application** developed as part of the research article:  

> **Gugulica & Burghardt (2025).** *Place-Based Semantic Search: A Framework for Inferring and Modeling Place Semantics from Geosocial Media Data.*  

## **About the Project**  

**SemantiPlace** demonstrates the **practical application** of our research methodology, enabling **place-based semantic search** through geosocial media data. The framework allows users to **analyze and compare place semantics**, offering unique insights into how locations are perceived, described, and discussed on social media platforms such as **Twitter, Instagram, and Flickr**.  

By leveraging **natural language processing (NLP)** and **geospatial analysis**, the app provides an interactive way to explore **semantic similarities between places**, helping researchers, urban planners, and location-based service providers gain deeper contextual understanding of geographic spaces.
